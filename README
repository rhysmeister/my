optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --repl
                        Show replication and status summary for the cluster. The following colour scheme is used to indicate status;

                        1. Host is down - RED
                        2. Host is up but MariaDB is down - WHITE
                        3. Host is up and MariaDB is up and replication is up - GREEN
                        4. Host is up and MariaDB is up and replication is down - YELLOW

                        Fields
                        =======

                        hostname: 	The hostname of the cluster node.
                        port:		The tcp port of the MariaDB instance.
                        cons:		Total number of MariaDB sessions.
                        u_cons:		Total number of user connections. Note the 'user' connections are considered to be usernames ending with 'ro' or 'rw'.
                        role:		The role of the cluster node. Note this is determined dynamically.
                        		m = Master
                        		ms = Master Slave
                        		s = Slave
                        		mms = Multi-Master Slave

                        		A MariaDB is considered a master if Slaves are connected.
                        		A MariaDB is considered a Slave if the command "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" returns something.
                        		A MariaDB is considered a Multi-Master Slave if the command "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" returns more than one record.
                        		A MariaDB can be a both a Master and a Slave.

                        repl_detail:	If replication is running then some status information is displayed. This is in the following format;

                        		<master hostname>:<master port> <master binlog> <master pos>

                        		If the MariaDB instance is configured with multiple Master then multiple lines are displayed with the connection name.

                        lag:		The number of seconds the Slave is lagging from its Master.
                        gtid:		The GTID the Slave has last processed.
                        read_only:	ON / OFF. Is the server set to read_only?

                        ======================================================================
  --audit               Displays a selection of MariaDB configuration values.
  --audit_file AUDIT_FILE
                        Override the default choice of global variables displayed by my. This must be a text file located in the same directory as my called <anything>.cfg. It should contain a comma seperated list on a single line. The filename should be supplied without the .cfg extension.
  --global_variable GLOBAL_VARIABLE
                        Query a global variable for the MariaDB cluster.
  --stacktrace          Python stacktrace is not show by default. Use this flag to enable it.
  --mb                  Display relevant variables in MB in the --audit display.
  --global_variables_diff {all,diff}
                        Perform a diff on the MariaDB global variables in the cluster.
  --exclude_prefix EXCLUDE_PREFIX
                        Used in conjunction with --global_variables_diff to exclude variables with a prefix.
  --show_databases      Display the databases hosted on each node in the cluster.
  --show_slave_hosts    Display the slave hosts connected to each node in the cluster.
  --show_plugins        Display plugins installed in each node in the cluster.
  --show_engines        Display engines installed in each node in the cluster.
  --global_status GLOBAL_STATUS
                        Query a global status value for the MariaDB cluster.
  --start_slave START_SLAVE
                        Slave to start in the format of <hostname>:<port>. Only the default slave connection is handled.
  --stop_slave STOP_SLAVE
                        Slave to stop in the format of <hostname>:<port>. Only the default slave connection is handled.
  --query QUERY         Specify a query to execute against all hosts in the cluster.
